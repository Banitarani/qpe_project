       <i style="color: rgb(5, 251, 5);"><u> HELPS IN EXPLORING THE OUTER WORLD:</u></i>
        Students’ lives are not restricted to textbook definitions and physics formulae to remember. The outer knowledge and wisdom are equally important. Non-Academic learning helps the students in knowing what is happening in the outer world. The extra-curricular activities of any genre give a helping hand to students’ inquisitive minds and support them in exploring the world outside their textbooks.
